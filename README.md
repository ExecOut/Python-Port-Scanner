## Description

very simple port scanner, it is slow but it works. Mainly intended to be a project for learning. 

# HOW TO USE

~The program will ask for the port_min which is the port number that you want to scan from.

~The program will then ask for port_max which is the port number that you want to end scanning at.

~Once this has been established, the program will ask you if you want to save the file with a y/n prompt. y for yes and n for no.
